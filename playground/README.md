## Playground

Welcome to Artificial Invaders playground. Here you can see the basic game design, play around the arena and test different solutions on your own. Enjoy!

## Game logic

(Note that these rules might still be revised slightly in the future.)

Each side, red and blue, has two robots that play against each other. Use your two robots to collect energy cores and make your mothership stronger.  Points are increased by collecting positive yellow energy cores to the mothership and points are lost by receiving negative green energy cores. If the mothership receives 3 negative energy cores the mothership is destroyed and the opponent wins. If both motherships are alive at the end of a 2 minute tournament, the mothership holding greater energy status will overpower their opponent and win. In case of a tie, the team that collected their points fastest, wins.
